# Product Guidelines: Wesley's CPR

## Brand Voice & Tone
- **Professional & Authoritative:** Communication must reflect deep clinical expertise and adherence to safety standards. Use a confident tone that establishes Wesley's CPR as a leader in life-saving education.
- **Efficient & Action-Oriented:** Respect the user's time. Instructions, booking steps, and course details should be direct, concise, and easy to navigate for busy professionals.
- **Contextual Clarity:** Use industry-standard terminology (BLS, AHA, ACLS) to maintain professional standing, but provide brief explanations for non-medical users to ensure the site remains accessible to the community.

## Visual Identity
- **Safety & Reliability:** The design should utilize a clean, structured layout with a "healthcare-first" color palette (primarily Red, White, and Blue).
- **Trust Indicators:**
    - **Affiliation Logo Bar:** A dedicated section showcasing logos of fire departments and healthcare organizations to provide immediate social proof.
    - **Strategic Trust Badges:** Small badges (e.g., "AHA Authorized Provider") should be placed near "Book Now" buttons to reinforce confidence at the moment of conversion.
- **Typography:** Use clean, sans-serif fonts that prioritize readability and professional presentation.

## Content & Credibility
- **Social Proof:** Prioritize the integration of overall Google Review ratings to provide external validation. If a live integration is not feasible, use direct student quotes accompanied by names.
- **Instructor Expertise:** Highlight real-world clinical experience (EMS/Fire) in bios to differentiate the training quality from generic competitors.
- **Transparency:** All pricing and policy information must be presented clearly without hidden fees, aligning with the brand's commitment to honesty and reliability.
